//! System information collection module
//! 
//! This module provides functions to collect various system information
//! during UEFI boot, including device tree, firmware, boot time, and CPU information.

// No imports needed for placeholder functions

/// Find the device tree blob (DTB)
/// 
/// This function searches for a device tree blob, which is typically used
/// on ARM/ARM64 systems for hardware description.
/// 
/// # Returns
/// 
/// * `Some((u64, u64))` - Tuple of (DTB pointer, DTB size) if found
/// * `None` - If no device tree is available
/// 
/// # Note
/// 
/// This is currently a placeholder implementation. Device tree support
/// needs to be implemented based on the target architecture.

    // 2. Looking in memory regions where the bootloader might have placed it
    // 3. Parsing the device tree header to validate it
    
    None

/// Collect firmware information
/// 
/// This function gathers information about the UEFI firmware, including
/// vendor string and revision information.
/// 
/// # Returns

/// collection needs to be implemented using UEFI system table access.
