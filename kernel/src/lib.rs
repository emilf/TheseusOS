//! TheseusOS Kernel Library (Single-Binary Architecture)
//!
//! This library provides the kernel functionality for the unified UEFI+kernel binary.
//! It exports `kernel_entry` which is called directly by the UEFI bootloader after
//! exiting boot services. Integration tests also import functions from this library.

/// Unified kernel entry point for single-binary boot
///
/// This is the main kernel entry function called directly by the UEFI bootloader
/// after it exits boot services. It receives a physical address pointing to the
/// handoff structure containing all system information collected by the bootloader.
///
/// ## Boot Flow
///
/// 1. Bootloader collects system information using UEFI Boot Services
/// 2. Bootloader calls `ExitBootServices`
/// 3. Bootloader calls this function with handoff structure address
/// 4. Kernel validates handoff and sets up environment
/// 5. Kernel establishes higher-half virtual memory mapping
/// 6. Kernel initializes heap, interrupts, and other subsystems
/// 7. Kernel enters idle loop or exits based on configuration
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `handoff_addr` - Physical address of the handoff structure
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics if:
/// - Handoff structure is invalid or malformed
/// - Critical initialization steps fail
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This function assumes:
/// - UEFI boot services have been exited
/// - Handoff structure is valid and accessible
/// - System is in a stable state for kernel initialization

/// Custom test runner for integration tests
///
/// This function is called by Rust's custom test framework to run all test cases.
/// However, we discovered that this mechanism has issues in bare-metal environments
/// where calling functions through the `&dyn Fn()` trait objects causes hangs.
///
/// **Current Status**: This function is kept for compatibility but is not used
/// in our current test implementation. Instead, we call test functions directly
/// from the `kernel_main` entry point to avoid the hanging issue.
///
/// **Why it doesn't work**: The issue appears to be related to how Rust's
/// custom test framework collects and calls test functions through trait objects
/// in a bare-metal environment. The `test()` call hangs indefinitely.
///
/// **Solution**: Direct function calls from `kernel_main` work reliably and
/// provide the same functionality without the framework overhead.
///
/// **Usage**: This function would be called by `test_main()` if we used the
/// standard custom test framework approach.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `tests` - Slice of function pointers to test functions
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// // This is what the framework would do (but doesn't work):
/// test_runner(&[&test_function_1, &test_function_2]);
/// ```
