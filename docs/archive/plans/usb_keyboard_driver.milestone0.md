# USB Keyboard Driver â€“ Milestone 0 Findings

Milestone 0 was about auditing prerequisites before writing any USB code. This note captures what we confirmed, the new visibility we added, and the gaps we still need to close before moving on to PCI/xHCI bring-up.

## Interrupt Delivery Baseline
- `kernel/src/interrupts/mod.rs:23` shows the IDT only routes the LAPIC timer (0x40) and COM1 RX (0x41); no shared interrupt vectors exist yet for future devices.
- Early boot masks the legacy PIC and NMI lines (`kernel/src/interrupts/apic.rs:63`) and assumes a LAPIC at the legacy base (`kernel/src/interrupts/apic.rs:136`), so we currently lack a tested fallback if MSI/MSI-X is unavailable.
- ACPI discovery already records IO APIC descriptors (`kernel/src/acpi/madt.rs:81`) and we map both LAPIC and IOAPIC MMIO windows as uncached (`kernel/src/memory/mapping.rs:258`, `kernel/src/memory/mapping.rs:283`).
- The serial driver is the lone user of IO APIC routing today, directly programming a redirection entry for COM1 (`kernel/src/drivers/serial.rs:376`). We now detect MSI/MSI-X capabilities during PCI enumeration (`kernel/src/drivers/pci.rs:287`), but enabling those interrupt modes is still future work.

## DMA-Capable Memory Inventory
- The persistent allocator now exposes contiguous allocation/free helpers for DMA workloads (`kernel/src/physical_memory.rs:755`), and `kernel/src/memory/dma.rs:1` wraps them in a zeroed, kernel-mapped `DmaBuffer`.
- Follow-up work: surface cache policy flags (write-back vs write-combining) and add pooled buffer lifetimes so drivers can recycle DMA memory rather than dropping to the global allocator.
- MMIO regions already use PCD/PWT flags when mapped (`kernel/src/memory/mapping.rs:258`), which is good for controllers, but we still need explicit APIs to map DMA buffers with the write-back policy xHCI expects.

## Hardware Inventory Logging Improvements
- The bootloader now tags PCI and USB device-path nodes (`bootloader/src/hardware.rs:360`, `bootloader/src/hardware.rs:413`) so xHCI controllers and USB keyboards show up in the handoff metadata.
- Kernel logging of the firmware-provided inventory is enabled by default (`kernel/src/config.rs:15`), which means every boot will emit the device list needed to correlate PCI bus IDs with USB endpoints during early debugging.
- With the new summaries (USB port/interface, PCI device/function numbering), we can sanity-check the QEMU topology before writing any enumeration code and confirm the keyboard is actually visible at boot.

## Next Steps Toward Milestone 1
- Add MSI/MSI-X enablement helpers (and IO-APIC fallback policy) so future USB drivers can opt into edge-triggered interrupts cleanly.
- Extend the new DMA helper with cache hints and lifetime management, then start migrating upcoming drivers to it.
- Program PCIe bridges during enumeration so we can assign bus numbers ourselves when firmware leaves them at defaults.
