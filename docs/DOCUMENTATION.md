# TheseusOS Documentation Overview

This document explains how TheseusOS is documented and why good documentation is important for learning operating system development.

## Why Documentation Matters

When learning about operating systems (or any complex programming topic), good documentation is essential because:

1. **Learning**: Clear explanations help you understand how things work
2. **Reference**: You can quickly look up what functions do and how to use them
3. **Examples**: Good documentation shows you how to use the code correctly
4. **Safety**: Especially important in systems programming where mistakes can crash your computer

## Our Documentation Philosophy

TheseusOS is designed as an educational project, so our documentation focuses on:

1. **Beginner-Friendly**: Written for people who might be new to Rust or operating systems
2. **Complete**: Every function and module is thoroughly documented
3. **Educational**: Explains not just what the code does, but why it does it
4. **Consistent**: All documentation follows the same format and style

## How We Document Code

### Function Documentation (The Standard Format)

Every function in TheseusOS follows this clear format:

```rust
/// Brief description of what the function does
/// 
/// More detailed explanation if needed, including context about when
/// and why this function should be used.
/// 
/// # Parameters
/// 
/// * `param1` - Description of the first parameter
/// * `param2` - Description of the second parameter
/// 
/// # Returns
/// 
/// * `Ok(value)` - Description of successful return
/// * `Err(error)` - Description of error conditions
/// 
/// # Safety
/// 
/// Safety requirements for unsafe functions
/// 
/// # Examples
/// 
/// ```rust
/// // Example usage
/// let result = example_function(param1, param2);
/// ```
```

**Why this format?** It's the standard Rust documentation format, so it works with tools like `cargo doc` and is familiar to Rust developers.

### Module Documentation

Each module includes:

```rust
//! Module title
//! 
//! Brief description of the module's purpose and functionality.
//! 
//! ## Overview
//! 
//! Detailed explanation of what this module provides and how it fits
//! into the overall system architecture.
//! 
//! ## Key Components
//! 
//! - Component 1: Description
//! - Component 2: Description
//! - Component 3: Description
//! 
//! ## Usage
//! 
//! How to use this module in your code.
```

### Type Documentation

All public types include:

```rust
/// Type name and brief description
/// 
/// Detailed explanation of the type's purpose, when to use it,
/// and any important implementation details.
/// 
/// # Fields
/// 
/// * `field1` - Description of the first field
/// * `field2` - Description of the second field
/// 
/// # Examples
/// 
/// ```rust
/// // Example of creating and using the type
/// let instance = TypeName::new();
/// ```
```

## What's Documented

### Kernel Modules (The Operating System Core)

All the core operating system modules are fully documented:

- **`lib.rs`**: Exports `kernel_entry` function (called by bootloader)
- **`environment.rs`**: Complete kernel initialization sequence with higher-half transition
- **`memory.rs`**: Virtual memory management, page tables, and frame allocation
- **`allocator.rs`**: Heap allocator management and permanent heap initialization
- **`gdt.rs`**: Global Descriptor Table and Task State Segment setup
- **`interrupts.rs`**: IDT, exception handlers, LAPIC timer configuration
- **`handoff.rs`**: Handoff structure validation and access
- **`cpu.rs`**: CPU feature detection and configuration
- **`display.rs`**: Kernel output and handoff structure display
- **`framebuffer.rs`**: GOP framebuffer management and drawing
- **`panic.rs`**: Panic handler for kernel errors
- **`boot.rs`**: Boot-time abort helpers
- **`stack.rs`**: Stack switching utilities

### Bootloader Modules (The UEFI Phase)

All the bootloader modules are fully documented:

- **`main.rs`**: UEFI entry point and main boot sequence
- **`boot_sequence.rs`**: System information collection and kernel handoff
- **`memory.rs`**: UEFI memory allocation and non-overlapping heap logic
- **`acpi.rs`**: ACPI table discovery and parsing
- **`hardware.rs`**: Hardware inventory collection via UEFI protocols
- **`system_info.rs`**: Firmware, CPU, and boot time information collection
- **`display.rs`**: Formatted output and handoff structure display
- **`drivers/`**: Output driver system (UEFI serial, QEMU debug, raw serial)
- **`serial.rs`**: Serial communication primitives

### Shared Library (Common Code)

The shared library contains code used by both bootloader and kernel:

- **`handoff.rs`**: The data structure that passes information between bootloader and kernel
- **`constants.rs`**: Important numbers and values used throughout the system
- **`macros.rs`**: Useful code shortcuts and utilities

## Documentation Features

### Safety Documentation

All unsafe functions include detailed safety documentation explaining:

- Why the function is unsafe
- What invariants must be maintained
- What can go wrong if used incorrectly
- How to use the function safely

### Error Handling

Documentation includes comprehensive error handling information:

- All possible error conditions
- When each error can occur
- How to handle errors appropriately
- Recovery strategies where applicable

### Examples

Where appropriate, documentation includes:

- Usage examples
- Common patterns
- Integration examples
- Best practices

## How to View the Documentation

### The Easy Way

To see all the documentation in a nice web interface:

```bash
# Generate and open documentation for all parts of TheseusOS
cargo doc --open
```

This will open your web browser and show you all the documentation in a searchable, easy-to-navigate format.

### Documentation for Specific Parts

If you only want to see documentation for one part:

```bash
# Just the kernel documentation
cargo doc -p kernel --open

# Just the bootloader documentation  
cargo doc -p bootloader --open

# Just the shared library documentation
cargo doc -p theseus_shared --open
```

### What You'll See

The documentation includes:

- **Search**: Find any function or type quickly
- **Cross-References**: Click on any type or function to see its definition
- **Source Code**: Click "source" to see the actual code
- **Examples**: See how to use functions correctly
- **Safety Info**: Important warnings for unsafe functions

## Maintenance

### Keeping Documentation Current

Documentation is maintained alongside code changes:

1. **Code Changes**: When modifying functions, update their documentation
2. **API Changes**: When changing public APIs, update all related documentation
3. **New Features**: New functionality includes complete documentation
4. **Refactoring**: When refactoring, ensure documentation remains accurate

### Documentation Review

All documentation changes are reviewed for:

- Accuracy and completeness
- Clarity and readability
- Consistency with project standards
- Proper formatting and structure

## Contributing to TheseusOS
